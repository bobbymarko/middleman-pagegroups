The built-in resource additions can be useful in designing your own
partials, templates, and helpers.

## Resources

Resource extensions are usually accessed in your templates, partials, and
helpers with `current_page`, and so the descriptions below will use this as an
example. However keep in mind that these methods apply to _any_ resource.

`current_page.breadcrumbs`

  : Returns an array of pages leading to the specified page.

`current_page.brethren`

  : Returns an array of all of the legitimate siblings of the specified page,
    returning them by ascending sort order.

`current_page.brethren_next`

  : Returns the next legitimate sibling of the specified page, or `nil` if it’s
    already the last page.

`current_page.brethren_previous`

  : Returns the previous legitimate sibling of the specified page, or `nil` if
    it’s already the first page.

`current_page.group_count`

  : Indicates the number of pages that are in the current group.

`current_page.legitimate_children`

  : Returns an array of all of the specified page’s legitimate children, sorted
    in ascending order by their sort order.
 
`current_page.navigator_eligible?`

  : Indicates whether or not the page is eligible for displaying a previous/next
    page indicator. It’s eligible if all of these conditions are met:
    
    - Its parent has front matter key `navigate` set to true.
    - It does _not_ have a front matter key `navigator` set to false.
    - It’s a legitimate page, i.e., has a sort order, not ignored, etc.

`current_page.page_group`

  : Indicates the name of the current page group. This can be useful for setting
    up CSS and performing conditional tasks. The name of the group is simply
    the name of the containing directory. Group names might not be unique.

`current_page.page_name`

  : Indicates the name of the current page. This can be useful for setting up
    CSS and performing conditional tasks. The name of the page is simply the
    output page name without an extension. Page names might not be unique.
 
`current_page.page_sequence`

  : Indicates the sequence of the page within its group, starting with one. You
    might use this directly as a page number, or use it indirectly if your page
    numbers don’t start at one.
    
    Pages without sort orders will return `nil` for this value.

`current_page.sort_order`

  : Indicates the sort order of the page, or 0 if no order has been assigned.
