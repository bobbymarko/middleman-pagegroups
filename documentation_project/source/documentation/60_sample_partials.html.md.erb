Although `middleman-pagegroups` has a useful set of [helpers](helpers), you can
use its sample partials instead. This gives you the obvious ability to customize
them to suit your own needs.

For convenience you can find them in this sample project’s `source/partials/`
directory, or you can generate them on demand if `middleman-pagegroups` gem is
installed:

~~~ bash
middleman-pagegroups partials <directory>
~~~

If you don’t specify a `<directory`> then the files will be placed into your
current working directory.

## The partials

The partials are named identically to the [helpers of the same name](helpers),
and they work identically and take the same optional `locals` parameters. For
details of these partials, the links lead to [Helpers](helpers).

**Caveat**: the `locals` parameters work _almost_ the same. For partials, you
must **not** use `:class`; use `:klass` instead. This is a limitation due to
the way that Middleman (really, Padrino) implements partials. These `locals`
become actual, local variables in the helpers, and the word “class” is not a
valid local variable name (it’s a reserved word).

Middleman geek knowledge: when you generate partials using the
`middleman-pagegroups partials` command, it’s not just a file copy. The partials
are generated from the same source code that is used by the helpers, except for
`_nav_toc_index.haml` which has some tricky recursion going on.
